# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

Active development. Implemented and covered by tests, each with its own
`docs/features/*.md` for the full detail — read the relevant doc before
touching that area rather than expecting this section to carry it:

- **Site shell** (header/nav/footer, mobile nav, dark mode) —
  `docs/features/home.md`. Header nav is a flat Home/Projects/About link
  row plus a Résumé button, not a dropdown (`internal/handler/nav.go`'s
  `primaryNavItems`); Settings is a separate auth-gated dropdown
  (Profile/Content/Resume/Security/Logout).
- **Resume** (Postgres-backed `/resume`) — `docs/features/resume.md`.
- **Resume Export** (`/resume/download.pdf` and `.docx`, plus browser
  Print) — `docs/features/resume-export.md`. Both files are generated in
  pure Go (`fpdf`/`go-docx`), deliberately *not* headless Chrome: a
  chromedp version shipped broken on Render (no Chrome binary) behind
  tests that only ever used a fake renderer — see that doc's Decision.
  The PDF's layout is Go code, so resume template changes that should
  show in the PDF need a matching `resume_pdf.go` change.
- **Resume Content Authoring** (`/settings/resume`: edit every card on
  `/resume` — banner, sidebar, summary, experience timeline — plus an
  independent font-preset choice per card, without a redeploy) —
  `docs/features/resume-content-authoring.md`. Code-complete and verified
  against a real database, but unreachable in production — see the auth
  note below.
- **Landing page** (`/`: hero, image carousel, "Selected work" card grid) —
  `docs/features/landing-page.md`, `docs/features/landing-carousel.md`.
- **Fishing Game** (`/fishing-game`, canvas mini-game, Postgres
  leaderboard, `localStorage` gear/tokens) —
  `docs/features/fishing-game.md`.
- **Kitchen Shift** (`/kitchen-shift`, canvas restaurant-shift sim,
  Postgres leaderboard, `localStorage` progress) —
  `docs/features/cooking-game.md` (plus `cooking-game-food-server.md`/
  `cooking-game-customer.md`/`cooking-game-kitchen.md`/
  `cooking-game-food-server-leveling.md`). v4 restyled it to match Library Shift and
  ported Library's Coffee Pour, hallucinations, 0-stat penalties and
  Gard counter. Both games draw people with
  `web/static/js/shared/people.js`, so a character-art change there
  shows up in both.
- **Puzzle Solver** (`/puzzle-solver`, client-side DFS pathfinding
  visualizer, no DB/leaderboard) — `docs/features/puzzle-solver.md`.
- **Library Shift** (`/library-game`, two-floor canvas library-shift sim —
  shelving/fines/borrow-request minigames, a scripted Karen event, Postgres
  leaderboard, `localStorage` progress) — `docs/features/library-game.md`.
- **Bus Stop Finder** (`/bus-stops`: geolocation or a 6-digit postal code
  (geocoded server-side via OneMap) → 5 nearest Singapore bus stops on a
  Google Map + live LTA DataMall arrivals, live bus positions and a
  per-bus "where this bus goes" route view, HTMX-polled every
  20 s; nightly LTA sync into Postgres) — `docs/features/bus-stop-finder.md`.
  The LTA key stays server-side; the page has its own nonce CSP only when
  `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set, so it must be reached by a full page load
  (its `/projects` card uses `FullPageLoad`, not an HTMX nav). Playwright
  uses the fake LTA in `cmd/fakelta` via `make run-e2e`, which also puts
  the bus tables in an isolated `bus_e2e` schema so the fake fixtures never
  mix with real synced LTA data in the default schema (the sync's 50% guard
  would refuse that swap anyway). Production needs `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY` and a
  referrer-restricted `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` provisioned.
- **Bus Rush** (`/bus-rush`, top-down canvas driving game — flee the police
  in a stolen bus (pursuit cars, roadblocks, wanted level), dodge oncoming
  traffic, collect fares, buy Engine/Steering/Bumpers/Fare Box upgrades;
  Postgres leaderboard, `localStorage` progress) — `docs/features/bus-rush.md`.
  Rules/tuning live in `web/static/js/busrush/rules.js`; no screenshot yet,
  so its `/projects` card shows the placeholder tile.
- **Projects** (`/projects` card grid: Fishing Game, Kitchen Shift, Puzzle
  Solver, Library Shift, Bus Stop Finder, Bus Rush) — `docs/features/projects.md`.
- **Content Authoring** (`/settings/content`: edit the landing page's
  hero/carousel/Selected work without a redeploy, Postgres-backed) —
  `docs/features/landing-content-authoring.md`. Code-complete but
  unreachable — see the auth note below.
- **Landing Content API** (`/api/internal/v1/landing/*`: bearer-token JSON
  API over the same three tables, so the separate `home-admin` dashboard
  can edit content without holding database credentials) —
  `docs/features/landing-content-api.md`. Site side implemented; not yet
  verified against a real database, and the Render reconfiguration it
  exists to enable is still outstanding.

Cross-cutting notes worth knowing before touching any of the above:

- **Auth is a stub**: `IsAuthenticated` (`internal/handler/auth_stub.go`)
  always returns `false`, so every `/settings/*` route redirects to a
  `/login` that doesn't exist yet. Any new auth-gated feature is
  code-complete but unreachable until the real authentication feature
  lands. The JSON API under `/api/internal/v1/` is the one exception — it
  authenticates machine callers by bearer token instead and must never
  use `requireOwnerAuth`, which redirects rather than returning 401.
- **Nav rollout is gradual and intentional, not a bug**: Blogs and Fishing
  Game are reachable only by direct URL (`/blogs`, `/fishing-game`), not
  linked from the header; Puzzle Solver isn't in the header nav either.
- **Visual design system** is "Organic" (warm cream ground, terracotta/
  sage accents, Caprasimo + Figtree), pulled from a claude.ai/design
  project and adapted into Tailwind tokens — see
  `docs/skills/tailwind-ui/SKILL.md`'s Visual Style. A from-scratch
  restyle of page-specific components (resume, fishing game, carousel) to
  the new tokens is still open.
- Blogs and About are still placeholders.

Update this file as decisions are made or change.

## What this is

A personal website for Vincent Megia, replacing the current resume site at vincentmegia.onrender.com. The new site keeps the resume content but expands into a fuller personal site, and links out to the original projects (including the current resume site itself) rather than reimplementing them.

## Planned content

- **Bio / About** — personal background, more than a resume covers
- **Resume** — the content currently on vincentmegia.onrender.com
- **Projects** — work in progress and past projects, linking out to their live/original locations where applicable
- **Personal interests** — a section outside of the professional/resume content

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend interactivity**: HTMX (server-rendered HTML, no separate JS frontend framework)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Skills and feature docs

Detailed, opinionated engineering conventions live in `docs/skills/` — read the
relevant one(s) before writing code in that area:

- `docs/skills/go-backend/SKILL.md` — Go backend structure, HTTP, security, testing
- `docs/skills/postgres/SKILL.md` — schema, migrations, queries, connection handling
- `docs/skills/htmx-ui/SKILL.md` — HTMX interactions, layout/template architecture
- `docs/skills/tailwind-ui/SKILL.md` — Tailwind design system and visual conventions

Every non-trivial feature should have a doc in `docs/features/`, based on
`docs/features/template.md`, describing its scope, UX, routes, data model, and
definition of done. Create one before implementing a new feature.

## Architecture plan

Server-rendered Go application: Go handlers render HTML via `html/template`,
HTMX handles partial page updates/interactivity without a client-side
framework, Tailwind provides styling, Postgres stores structured content
(e.g. resume entries — see `docs/features/resume.md`'s Data Model) so it can
be edited without redeploying static content.

Decided and in place:

- **Package layout**: `cmd/server` (entrypoint), `internal/{handler,service,
  repository,model,config,db}`, `web/{templates,static}`, `migrations/` — see
  `docs/skills/go-backend/SKILL.md`'s Project Structure.
- **Routing**: standard library `net/http.ServeMux` (Go 1.22+ method+pattern
  routing), registered in `cmd/server/main.go`'s `newMux`.
- **Templating**: `html/template`, one shared `base.html` shell + per-route
  content templates, each owning its own `<main id="main-content">` wrapper
  (required by `hx-swap="outerHTML"` — see `docs/features/home.md`'s HTMX
  Interactions). A route with real content beyond the shared placeholder sets
  `PageData.ContentTemplate`; see `docs/features/resume.md`'s Template
  Rendering section for why that dispatch happens in Go code, not the
  template itself.
- **Configuration**: layered defaults → optional `config.yaml` → optional
  `.env` → real environment variables, the last always winning. See
  `docs/skills/go-backend/SKILL.md`'s Configuration section,
  `config.example.yaml`, `.env.example`.
- **Migrations**: `goose`, embedded via `migrations/embed.go` and run
  automatically at server startup — see `docs/features/resume.md`'s Open
  Questions for why that's flagged as worth revisiting once Hosting is
  decided.
- **Build/dev tooling**: `Makefile` (`make help` lists targets) wraps Go and
  npm (Tailwind CLI) commands consistently — see
  `docs/skills/go-backend/SKILL.md`'s Code Quality section.
- **Testing**: `go test ./...` (includes a DB-gated end-to-end test in
  `cmd/server/e2e_test.go`, skipped without `DATABASE_URL`) plus a Playwright
  frontend suite in `e2e/` (`make test-e2e`), run against both Chromium and
  WebKit — the latter matters concretely, since it's already caught a real
  Safari-only bug (`docs/features/home.md`'s Business Rules).

## Open decisions

- **Hosting**: target is Vercel, but the stack is Go + Postgres. Vercel's Go support is serverless-function based, which has implications for persistent Postgres connections (pooling) and any long-lived server process — verify this fits before committing, or pick an alternative host (e.g. Render, Fly.io) that fits a standard Go server model more naturally.
- ~~**Database hosting**: needs a Postgres provider if not self-hosted~~ —
  **Decided: Supabase**, connected via its session pooler (not the
  transaction pooler/Supavisor, and not the direct connection — see
  `docs/features/landing-content-api.md`'s Status for why those two modes
  are a real risk with this app's `pgx`/`options`-param usage). The web
  app itself stays on Render; database and web service are no longer
  co-located, which is why `docs/features/landing-content-api.md`'s
  original "move to Render's internal connection string" plan is now
  permanently unavailable rather than pending — see that doc's
  Problem/Motivation and Decision 1.
- **Migration plan**: how/when vincentmegia.onrender.com gets replaced by the new site (DNS cutover, redirect, etc.) is not yet defined.
